Installation is usually as simple as running:

	./configure
	make
	make install

Nothing is compiled, since this "program" is just a shell script. What
happens is the configure script looks for programs needed to run this
script, then the make command substitutes the locations of those programs
in the script. The only fatal error can occur if the Bourne-again shell,
usually `bash' or `sh', or if a Perl interpreter cannot be found.
